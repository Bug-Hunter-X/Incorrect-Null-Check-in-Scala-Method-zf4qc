This repository demonstrates a common error in Scala related to null checks.  The initial code uses the 'eq' operator to compare objects for equality.  'eq' checks for reference equality (whether two objects are the same object in memory), whereas '==' checks for structural equality (whether two objects have the same value). In this case, '==' should be used to check if the input is null. The solution provides the corrected code using '==' for proper null handling.
